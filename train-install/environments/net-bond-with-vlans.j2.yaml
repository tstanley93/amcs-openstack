# This template configures each role to use a pair of bonded nics (nic2 and
# nic3) and configures an IP address on each relevant isolated network
# for each role. This template assumes use of network-isolation.yaml.
#
# FIXME: if/when we add functionality to heatclient to include heat
# environment files we should think about using it here to automatically
# include network-isolation.yaml.
#
# There is no longer a requirement to use net-bond-with-vlans-v6.yaml for
# nodes when deploying with IPv6. You may now define both an IPv4 network
# and an IPv6 network as default routes by adding both networks to the
# default_route_networks list for the Controller role in roles_data.yaml.
# Then include this environment file to use bond-with-vlans NIC configs.
